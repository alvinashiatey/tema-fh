              The prompt for the first year core class was centred around three
              homonyms–sight, site & cite–among which I chose to explore site.
              Initially situating myself as the site for inquiry, I later,
              through a number of self questioning turned my attention to Tema a
              place I call home. Tema is located 16 miles east of the capital
              city; Accra, in the region of Greater Accra, and is the capital of
              the Tema Metropolitan District. Constructed on the site of a
              former small fishing village, it was commissioned by Ghana’s first
              president, Kwame Nkrumah, and grew rapidly after the construction
              of a large harbour in 1961. The Greenwich Meridian Line
              (0°00’00.00”E/W) runs through the city. Dropping the pin to a more
              specific location within Tema, this project engages the Tema
              fishing harbour as a point of departure but also a point of return
              back home. A dialogue between land and sea, I juxtapose a 3d
              rendering of an ocean As a visual study this book borrows from the
              harbour photos of type on canoes put in dialogue with a 3d
              rendered ocean 3d rendering my own ocean. Making conversation
              between a 3d rendered ocean and the type. The dimensions of this
              book stems from that of a regular canoe from the dock.
